          I am an international student from Venezuela with a degree in Computer
          Science and a passion for all things computer.

          I got my first desktop computer at the age of 6 for the sole purpose
          of playing The Sims. Expansion after expansion, the requirements to
          play started to change, and I couldn't understand what this meant.
          What was RAM? CPU? Hard Drive? and why is my computer behaving
          differently? I found my answers, and with those answers in mind, I
          asked my dad for a new RAM memory. Like any other curious kid, I was
          excited to open the computer and install the new memory. Once the
          computer turned back-on and I saw the windows XP logo, I was hooked;
          filled with amazement and a sense accomplishment.

          Then came the internet, and with it, and endless resource of
          curiosity. How does it work? How do I style my blog to make it look
          better? How do I make the computer do what I want? Thankfully, the
          internet had all the answers. I learned about computer languages and
          how they work, How complex was to develop a game, how the computer
          hardware worked, and many other things. Of course, I started diving
          into HTML and CSS to modify and style my tumblr blog (laugh), and once
          again, that feeling of amazement and accomplishment, I was a kid
          again.

          I moved here to attend college. I spent years looking for a major that
          would offer me a lifetime of learning, wonder, and the feeling of
          accomplishment. During my journey, I took classes in Biology,
          Chemistry, Math, Anatomy, Humanities, and other disciplines, which
          left in me invaluable knowledge, and more importantly, I became aware
          of my thought process. <br></br>
          Ultimately, I circled back to my first passion, computers. I enrolled
          in the computer science program where I found what I was looking for.
          I learned about programming paradigms, computer architecture,
          compilers, networks, algorithms, problem-solving, and how to find
          solutions to the real world in a computer.

          Computer Science keeps me curious, makes me feel like a kid, and
          provides me with neverending learning opportunities.
